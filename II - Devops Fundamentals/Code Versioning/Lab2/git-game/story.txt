Every day John was waking up at 8. AM, taking shower, having a breakfast and going to work.
But today strange thing happened. John woke up and went to the bathroom, where he saw a giant surprise party! He forgot that it was his birthday. 
His family turned the bathroom into a disco where everybody was dancing and having a great time. It was the perfect birthday party.
